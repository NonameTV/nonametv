Requirements

Update data from each source independently. Some sources need to be updated
hourly, while others are updated weekly.

Only upload files to the website that have actually changed.

Keep the latest set of data in a database.

Use UTC times in the database (?) or include timezone information.

Have as little redundant data as possible.

Use a format that can be converted into the current xmltv-format.

All records must have a starttime and a stoptime. Or length instead? 
Not both!

Keep all sensitive data (usernames/passwords and in some cases url:s)
in configuration files to avoid distributing them with the source-code.

One input plugin per inputformat. Each plugin in a separate file.

One output plugin per outputformat. Each plugin in a separate file.

Well documented interfaces between inputs and outputs.

Importer
--------

Command-line: nonametv-import Viasat

NonameTV::Importer::Viasat

sub import( $conf, $ds )

Calls delete_batch, start_batch, add_programme*, end_batch.

DataStore
---------

start_batch( $batch_id );
end_batch( $batch_id );

delete_batch( $batch_id );

add_programme( $data );

Exporter
--------

Command-line: nonametv-export XmlTV

NonameTV::Exporter::XmlTV

export( $conf, $ds );

How can it extract data from the datastore? Raw SQL?
