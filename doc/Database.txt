Notes regarding the database format
===================================

The database consists of three tables:

channels
--------

One record for each channel that we have data for. The channels
table must be updated manually and is only read by the nonametv-
programs.

batches
-------

Data is imported in batches. A batch is the smallest unit of data
that can be changed. If anything changes in the programming data
(such as a new movie being shown), an entire batch of programmes
must be removed and then added again.

Each batch has a unique name that must be consistent between
updates. The name should contain the name of the tv-company
or channel (depending on if data arrives in one batch per
channel or per tv-company) and some kind of period-identifier
such as year and week or date.

programs
--------

One record per program. Each record contains a channel_id and a 
batch_id. All times are represented in UTC timezone.
