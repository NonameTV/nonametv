"Delivery" describes how the Importer gets the data.

"Organization" describes how the data is mapped into batches. "daily" means that
each file describes one day and it is mapped into a single batch per day. "weekly" 
means that each file describes one week and it is mapped into a single batch per week.
"split" means that each file contains a varying amount of days. Therefore the file
is split into one batch per day.

"Format" is self-explanatory.

"Structured" yes means that starttime, title etc can ba found at specific locations
in each data file. no means that the data is split into paragraphs and then the
importer looks at each paragraph to decide if it is a starttime, a title or a
description based on its content and the content of previous paragraphs.
