Downloading TV-schedules from a Swedb server
============================================

Background
----------

The site `tv.swedb.se <http://tv.swedb.se>`_ was started in 2004 to
provide TV-schedules for Swedish channels. It was originally only used
for providing data via the grabber tv_grab_se_swedb (part of the
`XMLTV Project <http://www.xmltv.org>`_), but since then a number of
other programs have been written that utilize the same data files.

The data-format is based on the xmltv-format. It is generic and is not
specific to Sweden in any way. We are hoping that data will be
provided for other countries in the same format in the future, so that
the same applications can be used in several different countries.

This document describes how to write a program that downloads data
from the tv.swedb.se servers. Since the tv.swedb.se project is run on
a voluntary basis with no income generated from the service, it is
important to us that all our users behave properly and don't put an
unnecessarily high load on our servers. Please follow the rules below
if you want to use our data.

Data Layout
-----------

Data is stored in a number of separate gzipped xml-files that can be
downloaded from an http-server. To download data, you should start by
retrieving the root-url. For tv.swedb.se, the root-url is
`http://tv.swedb.se/xmltv/channels.xml.gz
<http://tv.swedb.se/xmltv/channels.xml.gz>`_. The root-url for Sweden will
likely remain the same for the foreseeable future, but there might be
data-sources available in the future, so you should make the root-url
user configurable.

This file describes which channels are available and where data can be
found for each channel. A typical entry looks like this::

  <channel id="svt1.svt.se">
    <display-name lang="sv">SVT1</display-name>
    <base-url>http://xmltv.tvsajten.com/xmltv/</base-url>
    <icon src="http://xmltv.tvsajten.com/chanlogos/svt1.svt.se.png"/>
  </channel>

The contents of the channel-entry is the same as specified by the
xmltv-dtd with the addition of the base-url element. The base-url
specifies where data for this particular channel can be found. Note
that one base-url is specified for each channel. Right now, all
channels use the same base-url, but this might change in the future.
If a channel-entry specifies more than one base-url for the channel,
the grabber shall use the first base-url.

The actual programs for each channel are stored in one file per
channel and day in the location specified by the base-url for the
channel. The name of each file is <id>_<yyyy-mm-dd>.xml.gz. As an
example, the data for SVT1 on July 2nd, 2006, can be found at
http://xmltv.tvsajten.com/xmltv/svt1.svt.se_2006-07-02.xml.gz

Each of these files follow the xmltv dtd, with the exception that they
don't contain any <channel> elements.

A valid xmltv file can be constructed from the above data by removing
all base-url fields from channels.xml.gz and outputting the relevant
channel-entries concatenated with the contents of all program-files
with the first and last lines omitted.

HTTP Caching
------------

All http-requests against swedb-servers must implement http-caching
properly. The cache must be stored persistently. Each http-response
from a swedb-server contains a Last-Modified field and/or an ETag
field. These fields shall be used in subsequent requests for the same
url as If-Modified-Since and If-None-Match respectively.

For a tutorial on http-caching, see
`http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2002/10/21/http_conditional_get_for_rss_hackers
<http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2002/10/21/http_conditional_get_for_rss_hackers>`_.

The reason for these caching requirements is that programme data
change infrequently and by utilizing http caching, the bandwidth
requirements for our servers decrease drastically.

Proper User-Agent
-----------------

All http-requests must include a User-Agent value that is unique to
this particular version of the grabbing application. The User-Agent
shall consist of an alphanumeric string that is unique for the
program, followed by "/" and an alphanumeric
versionnumber. Optionally, more information may be added with a space
after the version-number followed by an arbitrary string. 

**Examples:**

- xmltv/0.5.44
- AirTimes/0.9 (Symbian OS; MIDP-1.0 MIDP-2.0; CLDC-1.0; en)

The User-Agent gives us two advantages: 

- It allows us to gather statistics of which grabbers are in use. We
  can then share these statistics with the grabber authors.
- It allows us to block non-conforming grabbers.

We will always work with grabber authors before we decide to block a
grabber. The reason that we may want to block a grabber is primarily
that the grabber contains a bug that leads to unnecessarily high
bandwidth usage, e.g. if the grabber fails to implement http-caching
properly or requests data too often.

Update Interval
---------------

A grabber should normally download data at most once a day. If you
feel that your particular grabber needs to download data more often
than that, please contact us.

Update time
-----------

If your application fetches data automatically, it must not have a
hard-coded time at which it fetches data. The time must be
user-configurable and it should be randomized as default. If a lot of
users try to download data from our servers at the exact same time,
our servers suffer a lot.

Parallel requests
-----------------

An application may run up to two http-requests against the
swedb-servers simultaneously, but not more than that.
