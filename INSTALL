Installing NonameTV
-------------------

PREREQUISITES

MySQL-server, at least version 4.0. This is necessary since transactions
are used. The MySQL-server must be configured with support for InnoDB
tables.

A lot of perl-modules... You will find out which ones along the way.

wvHtml from http://wvware.sourceforge.net/

sitecopy from http://www.lyra.org/sitecopy/

INSTALLATION

Create a new mysql database called listings.

Create tables in the database and populate them with tables by running the
commands in examples/listings.sql. Then populate the channels and trans_cat
tables with data from examples/channels.txt and trans_cat.txt. This can be
done with the following (untested) MySQL command:

LOAD DATA INFILE 'channels.txt' INTO TABLE channels
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"';

LOAD DATA INFILE 'trans_cat.txt' INTO TABLE trans_cat
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"';

Create a directory called /var/local/nonametv.

Create the following directories under /var/local/nonametv:

cache
xmltv
xmltv_staging
xmltv_compare
data
override
override/data
override/delete
override/new
xmltv_old

Also create a directory /var/log/nonametv/

Make sure that the user you intend to run the scripts as can read/write the
directories above.

Copy nonametv.conf to /etc/nonametv.conf.

Edit /etc/nonametv.conf to match your installation.

Setup sitecopy to upload files from /var/local/nonametv/xmltv to your
webserver. This is the data that is downloaded by tv_grab_se_swedb.

Explore the commands in tools/. Start by looking at nonametv-cronjob.
The only command that must be run manually is

perl -I lib tools/nonametv-export Xmltv --export-channels

(run from the nonametv-directory). It creates the channels.xml.gz file.

Most of the commands take one or several --verbose parameters.

Note that not all commands in tools/ are actually working...

Everytime data is imported or exported, an entry is written to 
/var/log/nonametv/nonametv.log.
