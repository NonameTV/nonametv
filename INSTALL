Installing NonameTV
-------------------

PREREQUISITES

MySQL-server, at least version 4.0. This is necessary since transactions
are used. The MySQL-server must be configured with support for InnoDB
tables.

A lot of perl-modules... You will find out which ones along the way.

wvHtml from http://wvware.sourceforge.net/

sitecopy from http://www.lyra.org/sitecopy/

INSTALLATION

Create a new mysql database.

Create tables in the database and populate them with data by running the
commands in examples/listings.sql.

Create a directory called /var/local/nonametv.

Create the following directories under /var/local/nonametv:

cache
xmltv
xmltv_staging
xmltv_compare
data
override
override/data
override/delete
override/new
xmltv_old

Make sure that the user you intend to run the scripts as can read/write the
directories above.

Copy examples/nonametv.conf to /etc/nonametv.conf.

Edit /etc/nonametv.conf to match your installation.

Setup sitecopy to upload files from /var/local/nonametv/xmltv to your
webserver. This is the data that is downloaded by tv_grab_se_swedb.

Explore the commands in tools/. Start by looking at nonametv-cronjob.
The only command that must be run manually is

perl -I lib tools/nonametv-export Xmltv --export-channels

(run from the nonametv-directory). It creates the channels.xml.gz file.
Additionally, some of the Importers (Discovery) must be run manually
to import data from files received via email.

Note that not all commands in tools/ are actually working...
