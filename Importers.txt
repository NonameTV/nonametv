Importing from mail

- Run getmail to fetch mail from pop-server.
- getmail pipes all downloaded messages to nonametv-mailfilter
- nonametv-mailfilter figures out which Importer should handle this
  mail and places all attached files under /var/nonametv/data/<Importer>/.
  The filename should be an integer that is stored in the state-table
  for each Importer.
- Run nonametv-import-mail from cron. It looks under 
  /var/nonametv/data/ and runs
  nonametv-import <Importer> <filename>
  for each file that it finds. Make sure that the files are processed 
  in alphabetical order.

- The importer runs.

Dummy importer

Run nonametv-import-test <importer> <contentname> <filename>
Call Importer::ImportFile( <contentname>, <filename> );
Some grabbers will use the contentname as batchname, some of them will
disregard the contentname and find the batchnames inside the file.
